This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to mutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create two mutable references to the same variable, leading to a compile-time error. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.rs`, showcases how to resolve this using techniques like interior mutability (e.g., using `RefCell` or `Mutex`).  Understanding this issue is crucial for writing safe and efficient Rust code.
